            <p>Making your business more energy efficient is easier than you might think. Even small changes can make a big difference. By going green, you can save money on overheads and also promote a positive brand image for your company. Your customers will know that they’re supporting a business who cares about energy use and the environment.</p>.
            <p>Here are three ways to make your business more energy-efficient.</p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">1. Shut Down at Night</h2>

            <p>It may seem like a no-brainer, but encouraging you employees to be more environmentally aware can be financially beneficial for your business. Ask your employees to switch off all of their computers and equipment overnight, including printers, scanners and coffee machines.</p>

            <p>Utilise sleep and power saving modes on all electronics so that they go into an energy-saving mode after they have been idle for a while. Also, disable the use of screensavers as they do not actually conserve power. Instead, set the display to turn off automatically if the user has been inactive.</p>
            


            <h2 class="section-heading">2. Lighting and Heating</h2>

            <p>These are two areas that you’re likely to spend a lot on as a business. If possible, maximise the amount of natural lighting in your workplace as this will reduce the amount of power consumed by artificial lights. Also, you can make a big difference to your energy consumption simply by switching off lights when they’re not required and replacing your bulbs for energy-efficient ones.</p>

            <p>Most heating systems are fitted with regulators or a programmable thermostat. Set the temperature controls to match the season or weather conditions and the time controls to fit the working day. These little steps will help you save energy and reduce your heating costs. </p>

            

            <h2 class="section-heading">3. Invest in Going Green</h2>

            <p>If you have the money to invest in energy-efficient devices, look into buying <b>A-rated energy efficient products</b>. These will improve your levels of energy consumption so although it may be more expensive initially, energy-efficient products can save you money in the long run</p>


            <p>Your company, by law, must meet the EU’s standards for improving air quality and reducing emissions; releasing harmful emissions could result in a hefty fine for your company. If you’re unsure of how your business can reduce emissions then you should consult the experts, such as <b>ERG Air Pollution Control</b>. They can provide effective air pollution and odour control solutions to help your company go green and save money.</p>

            <p>Follow our three top tips to help your small business become more energy efficient and environmentally friendly. Even if you cannot afford to invest in some of the more expensive solutions, the small changes will make a big difference in the amount of energy that you consume.</p>
