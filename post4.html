            <p>Often, when we think about climate change and global warming, our natural inclination is to focus in on the large-scale challenges facing our planet. However, it’s also important to recognize that the kinds of changes climate change brings are not just about broad generalizations concerning the future</p>.
            <p>Instead, they’re issues that have the propensity to change people’s lives, not in some future version of reality, but right now.</p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">Natural disasters increasing in intensity</h2>

            <p>The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season has provided a fitting backdrop with which to begin this conversation. The season will come to a close on November 30th, and at this point it’s been one of mass devastation certainly: the estimates for hurricanes Harvey, Jose, Maria, and Irma, have been reported at $200 billion dollars.</p>
            <p>Each dollar represents the places and things that thousands of people had used to live their lives. But more profoundly, so far, 103 people have lost their lives in the midst of these massive storms.</p>
            <p>Climate change didn’t cause the hurricanes to occur, seasonal weather occurrences were seasonal before the threat of climate change.</p>
            <p>However, as Sean Sublette, a meteorologist with Climate Central, told CNN, “The short version is, climate change makes these very bad storms worse. It’s not the proximate cause of the storm, but it makes these bad storms worse. And in the case of a really bad storm, climate change can make it totally disastrous or catastrophic.”</p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">Wider impact of diseases</h2>

            <p>Another impact of global warming is its ability to cause diseases to spread, because many types of diseases thrive in warm, wet climates.</p>

            <p><b>Infectious:</b>Cholera, which kills over 100,000 people every year, is predominantly problematic in the summer, but is far less pervasive in the winter. Salmonella, which is foodborne, has the easiest amount of time reproducing in warm climates. These gastrointestinal diseases will thus only be fortified by future global warming trends. </p>

            <p><b>Vector-born:</b> These diseases are spread by insects that thrive in warm temperatures that prolong their lifespan. Illnesses like Zika and Malaria are predominantly spread by infected mosquitoes.</p>

            <p>“Changes in infectious disease transmission patterns are a likely major consequence of climate change. We need to learn more about the underlying complex causal relationships, and apply this information to the prediction of future impacts, using more complete, better validated, integrated, models,” concluded<b> the World Health Organization</b> in a summary on climate change and infectious diseases.</p>

            <p>The health impacts of the types of diseases that flourish in warmer climates have the ability to impact people like never before</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Changes made to the Environmental Protection Agency</h2>
            <p>In the<b> U.S. EPA’s own words</b>, “The mission of EPA is to protect human health and the environment.” They accomplish that end by doing a number of things including studying environmental issues, pushing legislative change, and giving grants.</p>

            <p>“The Clean Power Plan, which was created during former President Obama’s administration, intended to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The EPA estimated the plan would prevent 3,600 premature deaths per year,” notes the University of Arizona.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Immense industrial growth:</h2>

            <p>As people are increasing rapidly and for that people need work place and for this reasons immense industry grow everywhere rather to think environment save .Though industry plays an important rules to rapid grow our economy but excessive industry set up run a negative impact on our environment. A proper management of industrial growth can bring us a better output in our economy and our environment.</p>

            <p>Every government should impose a law so that industrial waste cannot get mixed in our river, cannel, and see water as water is a valuable element in our environment, on the other hand chemical produce industry should not allow near the river side area to save our environment.</p>

            <p>It is true that emitting smoke from the industry also causes air pollution and for this we should take proper steps so that our air cannot get excessively polluted by industrial fume.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Virus attack into human body:</h2>


            <p>Now invention of  new  virus are the common phenomenon in our world , if we notice several virus take human life like Ebola virus and Jika virus , at first that virus create  in nature  and than predominate in human body. Researcher say that this types of virus can grow for increasing of carbon dioxide in our environment as we excessively increase carbon oxide in our environment by burning oil and our valuable forest.</p>

            <p>Virus affect human body not only increases of carbon di oxide but also use of toxic chemical in our food growing field. Recently Ebola virus took thousands of lives in Africa region which broke out an epidemic shape.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Destroy forest:</h2>


            <p>Destruction of forest is the main reason for create environmental problem, it is the root cause of increase of carbon di oxide in our environment and that increased level carbon di oxide create several types of natural disaster in every year. At present the number of disaster are gradually increasing in a year and make irrecoverable loss which destroy thousands of human lives and create economic loss of the affected country</p>

            <p>For being save ourselves we should save our environment so that we can save our future generation if world temperature is increasing like present situation than our land area  must go under water so we should aware immediately before situation going out of control .</p>
